# CONCLUSION
The outlet should capitalize on Large size Classic, Supreme, Veggie and Chicken pizzas.
Since XL and XXL pizzas account for such a small percentage of their sales (just 1.94%), they can safely get rid of these pizza sizes.
Even though the Brie Carre pizza is the worst seller, it recorded 490 pizzas sold. It would still be a good idea to keep it in the menu.
